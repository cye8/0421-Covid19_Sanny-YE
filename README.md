# Crisis Management with Covid-19 Data
## Background 
xxx

By using the Solver in excel and grouping the schools into five groups, we are able to see how students’ financial circumstances affect their choices of which school to attend, and how possible it is for students to flow from unprivileged socio-economic class to a more privileged one after college.

### Business Question
How are students’ financial circumstances affect which schools they choose to attend? Is there a general pattern of what type of colleges tend to have a higher social mobility rate?
### Data Question 
How are different colleges grouped based on metrics related to parent/children income and social mobility?

## Conclusion
Based on the cluster analysis, we can summarize our findings as the following points: 1) students who attend large-scale community colleges tend to come from families with lower household income, but the social mobility rate of those schools tend to be the highest; whereas small colleges with relatively high parent income and more parents in the top 1% have the lowest mobility rate; 2) medium-size colleges/universities with average parent income has an average social mobility rate; 3) Although the mobility rate of larger universities and medium-size elite universities are the same, universities with higher rankings have a higher upper-tail mobility rate, which means that the percentage of students who have parents in the Bottom 20% of the income distribution and reach the Top 1% of the income distribution is the highest of all.
